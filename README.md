# Foodie Nerds Cookbook

Recipes for actual food, for and by people who use GitHub.

In the software industry I have had the chance to meet some people who are amazing cooks, as well as people who just order pizza every night because they can't feed themselves.

I am hoping that those of us who can cook will commit some good recipes for our fellow nerds. Recipes are often wrong or incomplete, so having them in GitHub will allow us to help make them better, and people can just do a pull to download the whole cookbook.
