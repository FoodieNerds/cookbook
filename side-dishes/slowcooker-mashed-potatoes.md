## Ingredients
* 5 lbs potatoes, peeled and cooked
* 2 cups milk
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 8 oz package of cream cheese
* 1lb tub sour cream
* 1 Tbs diced garlic
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper

## Preparation
* Boil the potatoes to cook them. When they are early to break appart with a fork then they are done.
* Mash all ingredients together in the large mixer until smooth.
* Pour into slow cooker.
* Cover - cook on low for no more than 2 hours - watch for burning - add milk if they start to dry out.

## Notes
* Smaller potatoes taste better than giant ones. Balance that with how many potatoes you want to peel.
* This recipe is great for Thanksgiving, potlucks, or any time you have to bring a lot of mashed potatoes. This would not be a good choice for a normal, family dinner, unless you have a very large family.
