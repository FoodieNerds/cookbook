# Uncle Scott's Slammin' Southern Slaw

## Ingredients:

### Basic Ingredients:

* 1 Whole Cabbage
* 2 Medium White Onions
* 1 Cup White Vinegar
* 1 Cup White Sugar
* 0.5 TBSP Celery Seeds

### Optional Ingredients:

* 2 Jalapeno Peppers
* 1 TSP Smoked Paprika

### Equipment:

* An air tight container, taller than it is wide preferably, that fits into your fridge
* A food processor with a shredding blade, or an old-fashioned knuckle-buster
* A mixer, or a puree blade for your food processor

## Directions:

* Wash and stem the cabbage. Shred the cabbage and transfer to the storage container.
* Puree the onions. Mix in celery seeds and pulse to just blend.
* 2a. If you want to add jalapeno, seed, stem and puree it with the onions.
* Pour vinegar and sugar over the onion puree and pulse to blend.
* Pour vinegar mixture over the cabbage. Mix well with your hand until all clumps are gone. You should see that the celery seeds are evenly distributed.
* Press the cabbage down beneath the liquid. This may take some patience and force, but only use your hands to do this or you can damage the slaw.
* Seal and store in the fridge for at least 12, and preferably 24 hours.
