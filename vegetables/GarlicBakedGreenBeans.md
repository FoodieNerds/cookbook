# Garlic Baked Green Beans

![Garlic Baked Green Beans](https://github.com/FoodieNerds/cookbook/blob/master/vegetables/images/GarlicBakedBeans.jpg)

Also Baked Asparagus, Baked Zucchini, Baked Potatoes, Baked Broccoli, or probably baked any vegetable.  Getting my kids (and my wife) interested in vegetables is an ongoing challenge. The kids are kids, and my wife is from beef country so to her a chicken is a vegetable. This recipe is quick, versatile, dead easy, and if your kids are like mine they will shout at you for not making vegetables this way before now.

## Ingredients

* Some vegetables (really, it could be green beans, chopped zucchini, little potatoes that are chopped up, asparagus, broccoli, some combo of all of these, probably carrots, too).
* Olive oil
* Hard, parmesan cheese (the real kind that you grate)
* Chopped garlic
* Salt
* Pepper

## Preparation

* Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
* Set out a baking sheet and cover it with parchment paper.
* Chop or otherwise prepare enough raw vegetables for your dinner and put them in a large mixing bowl.
* Drizzle some olive oil on the vegetables. You just need enough to make the other things stick so one or two tablespoons is plenty.
* If you buy chopped garlic in a giant jar like I do, throw a couple of spoonfuls in the bowl.
* Grate enough parmesan over the vegetables to cover them like a light snowfall.
* Add a little salt and a lot of pepper.
* Reach into the bowl and mix it all up until the vegetables are coated.
* Spread the vegetables out on the baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 min.

## Notes

You can't cheap out on the cheese. You have to use real parmesan and grate it fresh or just don't do it. The rest is pretty flexible.
I have used this same recipe with many different vegetables, and it is always great. Also, if you have a little of a couple of vegetables, just throw them all in. It doesn't matter.

## Gear

To make this recipe really easy, I can't recommend enough that you get dishwasher safe,  standard size baking sheets, and pre-cut parchment paper that fits your baking sheets.  If you are not using these already, they will change your life. You will find so many uses for them.
