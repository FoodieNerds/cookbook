# French Market Beignets

Beignets are a French-Creole style donut, although they lack the familiar round shape. The perfect
accompanyment for coffee, beignets are a staple of life in New Orleans and the southern Gulf coast.

## Ingredients:
1. Dry Yeast            1 Packet
2. Warm Water           1.5 Cups
3. Granulated Sugar     0.5 Cups
4. Salt                 1 TSP
5. Whole Eggs           2
6. Evaporated Milk      1 Cups
7. All Purpose Flour    7 Cups
8. Softened Shortening  0.25 Cups
9. Peanut Oil           (Frying oil, depends on vessel size)

## Directions:
  * Put warm water in a large bowl and sprinkle in yeast. Stir until yeast is dissolved.
  * Add sugar, salt, eggs and milk. Whip together until well blended.
  * Add 4 cups of flour and beat until smooth.
  * Add Shortening and beat until blended.
  * Add remaining flour and beat until smooth once again.
  * Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator overnight.
  * On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to approximately 1/8" thickness, then cut into 2.5" squares.
  * Add oil to your frying vessel and bring to 360 degrees Farenheit.
  * Gently lay squares of dough, two to three at a time (depending on how large your vessel is) into the oil. Be sure to add them slowly, and one at a time in order to prevent sticking together.
  * Fry for just 2-3 minutes on each side, flipping once a light golden brown is achieved.
  * Remove to a paper towel lined plate and immediately cover in confectioner's sugar. Move sugared beignets to a different towel lined plate to continue draining.

### Notes:
  * Dough may be made several days in advance of cooking if stored properly in the refrigerator, well sealed. 
  * Failing to sugar the beignets immediately as they come out will cause the sugar to simply fall off and make for a messy nosh. Strike with sugar while they're hot!
  * Don't be surprised when the dough squares puff significantly during cooking. They don't all, but some do and can create an unwelcome splash of hot oil. So cook with care.
