# Dutch Oven Fried Chicken

This recipe started as a recipe for chicken and salad that was described as being easy to make, even on a busy weeknight. The recipe described buying all kinds of vegetables and chopping them in a food processor, etc. In my mind, I am envisioning having to clean all of that which seems silly when you can buy a bag of salad at the store and let your family use the salad dressing that they prefer. The recipe also called for baking the chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet and spraying the chicken with cooking spray. No. Just no. I am sure that it is fine, but it grosses me out to even think about it.

My recipe below is what is left after I ripped out the parts that I didn't like, and changed the way the chicken is cooked.

# Ingredients

* 8 chicken thighs
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* Kosher salt
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 1/2 cups panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

* Preheat oven to 400ºF.
* Put 2 Tbs of olive oil in a 5 quart, oven safe skillet and turn on medium heat.
* Mix flour and 1⁄2 teaspoon of the salt in a bowl or on a plate.
* Combine eggs and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a shallow dish or small bowl.
* Place panko in a separate shallow dish or bowl.
* Roll 1 thigh in flour, dip floured thigh in egg mixture; dredge in panko, pressing gently to coat cutlet completely, and place in skillet.
* Repeat procedure with remaining thighs.
* Brown the thighs for approximately three minutes on each side.
* Cover and bake in preheated oven until cutlets are golden brown and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Internal temp should be 165ºF.
