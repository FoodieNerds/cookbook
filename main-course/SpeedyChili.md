# Speedy Chili

When my Mom made chili she would let it simmer literally all day. That's great, but it always made me think that is how one makes good chili, and I just don't have that kind of time. My wife came up with this recipe that is pretty fast, and frankly, tastes just as good. My contribution is the optional bison and beer.

## Ingredients

* 1 chopped onion
* 1 chopped green pepper
* 2 lb. ground beef or bison
* 2 15 oz. cans Tomato sauce
* 2 cans diced tomatoes, do not drain
* 2 1lb cans Kidney beans, drained &amp; rinsed
* 2 cans black beans, drained &amp; rinsed
* 1 tsp. salt
* 3 tsp Chili powder
* 1 beer

## Preparation

* In at least a 5 Qt Pot, cook onion, pepper, and the meat until the meat is lightly browned. Drain.
* Add tomato sauce &amp; diced tomatoes; cook on low heat 5 min.
* Add kidney &amp; black beans &amp; salt. Heat.
* Stir in chili powder; taste. Add a little more if you like.
* Add beer.
* Simmer on medium for 15min and stir to avoid burning.
