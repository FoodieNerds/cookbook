# Immunity Soup

![Immunity Soup](https://github.com/FoodieNerds/cookbook/blob/master/main-course/images/ImmunitySoup.jpg "Immunity Soup")

We found this recipe on [Cooking Light](http://www.cookinglight.com/recipes/immunity-soup). It is mostly correct, but I made some changes to make it taste better and to make it slightly easier to cook. At its heart, this is chicken soup. I don't know how much science there is in calling it "Immunity Soup," but to quote Tom and Ray from [Cartalk](http://www.cartalk.com/), "It can't hurt."

# Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 3 celery stalks, thinly sliced
* 2 large carrots, thinly sliced
* 1 pound pre-sliced mushrooms
* 10 medium garlic cloves, minced (5 tsp)
* 8 cups unsalted chicken stock
* 3 tsp thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 (15-oz.) can unsalted garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained
* 2 pounds skinless chicken breasts, cubed
* 1 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 12 ounces spinach, roughly torn

# Preparation

* Heat oil in a 5Qt or larger Dutch oven over medium.
* Add onion, celery, and carrots; cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.
* Add mushrooms and garlic; cook, stirring often, 3 minutes.
* Stir in stock, thyme, bay leaves, and garbanzo beans; bring to a simmer.
* Add chicken, salt, and red pepper; simmer until the chicken is done, about 25 minutes. Stir occasionally.
* Stir the spinach into the soup; simmer about 5 minutes.
* Discard bay leaves.

# Notes

* You don't have to do this one thing at a time. You can start warming the oil while you chop the onion, then throw it in the pot and move on to the celery, etc. Start the timer once you get everything into the pot. I started cutting the chicken and throwing it in as soon as I added the garbanzo beans and then started the timer when I was done.
* The original recipe says to cover and simmer, but I leave the lid off and give it a stir occasionally.
* The original recipe called for Kale instead of spinach, but we are more of a spinach family. I suppose that you could use any leafy green vegetable.

# Gear

We have a 5 QT dutch oven and this recipe almost completely fills it. The cast iron keeps the soup warm a long time if you put the lid on after you turn off the heat.
