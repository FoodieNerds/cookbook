## Ingredients

* 8 oz uncooked egg noodle
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 (8-oz) pkg fresh whole mushrooms, sliced
* 1/2 C chopped onions
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 lb sirloin steak
* 1 (10 1/2 oz) can beef consommé
* 2 Tbsp ketchup
* 3 Tbsp flour
* 1 C sour cream (8-oz tub)
* Parsley (dry or chopped for topping) - optional

## Preparation

* Cook noodles to desired doneness as directed on package. Drain. Cover to keep warm.  
* Pound beef on both sides (see notes, below) and then cut into very thin strips.
* Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, add 1 Tbsp of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook 2-3 min or until tender. Remove mushroom mixture; set aside.  
* In the same skillet, add remaining 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Add beef; cook and stir until browned.
Reserve 1/3 C of beef consommé, and add the rest of the consommé, the ketchup, and mushroom mixture to the skillet; mix well.  
* Combine reserved consommé and flour in a bowl and whisk it well to blend. Gradually add to beef mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until thickened.
* Stir in sour cream; cook until thoroughly heated. DO NOT BOIL.
* Mix in the noodles and serve.

## Notes

* Once the cooking starts it goes pretty quickly so it is a good idea to get things chopped in advance.
* Sirloin is a pretty tough cut of meat so really tenderize the heck out of the steak with a tenderizing mallet. When you cut it into strips, use a sharp knife and make very thin strips. If you don't do these things, then beef will be very tough.
* At the end, you are supposed to gradually add the flour mixture while stirring, but that would require three hands. Just do your best.
* Make a vegetable to go with this. In the picture, you see my [baked green beans](https://github.com/FoodieNerds/cookbook/blob/master/vegetables/GarlicBakedGreenBeans.md). That is my next recipe.
* My family loves this recipe but the boys pick out the mushrooms.
* This original recipe was taken from the Pillsbury Complete Cookbook, page 112, but we have modified it.
