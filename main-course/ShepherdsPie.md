This is a family favorite and it makes leftovers that work great for lunches. This started as a recipe from my college roommate, but I have been updating it over the years, so it no longer bears any resemblance to the original. I don't know how authentic it is, but it sure is yummy.

## Ingredients


### Shepherd's Pie:
* 2 pounds meat (ground beef, lamb, or bison)
* 2 packs of instant mashed potatoes
* 1 onion, chopped
* Minced garlic to taste
* Black pepper to taste
* 1/4 cup Spoons Worcestershire Sauce
* 1lb frozen peas and carrots

### Gravy:
* 1/4 cup spoons of flour
* 1C milk
* 1 Tbs Herbs de Provenance

## Preparation

* Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.  
* Brown the meat in a big skillet with the onion, garlic, black pepper, and frozen peas and carrots.
* In a separate pot, make the mashed potatoes according to the directions on the packages.
* Drain excess grease from browned meat into a new, small pot.  
* Put Worcestershire Sauce into the meat and stir. Remove from heat.  
* Mix milk, flour, and herbs and pour into the pot with the grease and make gravy (slowly bring to boil on medium heat while continuously stirring - do not walk away).  
* When the gravy is ready (bubbly and thick looking), pour that into the big skillet with the meat and veggies and stir. You may not need all of the gravy.
* If you are baking in a casserole, put the meat mixture into a 3QT casserole (or other big dish). If you are using an oven-safe skillet then leave the meat where it is.
* Spread the mashed potatoes on top of the meat.
Bake the whole thing for 30 min at 350 degrees.
