This is a family favorite that is easy to make. It smells so great right from the start, that the first time I made it, my youngest son walked in the house while I was cooking and yelled, "Daddy! Make that one again!" It started life as a recipe on Delish.com, and I have cooked it several times, making small changes, to make it slightly less pretentious, and to work out issues with the directions. I also doubled the recipe so we end with a few leftovers for lunches.

## Ingredients

* 1 c. balsamic vinegar
* 1/4 c honey
* 3 tbsp. whole-grain mustard
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 8 bone-in, skin on, chicken thighs
* 4 c. baby red, potatoes, cut in 8ths (12oz bag)
* 1 Tbsp. Herbs de Provence
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil to cook the chicken

## Preparation

### Marinade

* In a large bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard, herbs, and garlic and season with salt and pepper.
* Whisk until combined.
* Add chicken thighs and toss until fully coated, then transfer to the fridge to marinate at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour.

### Prep potatoes:

* In a medium bowl, add potatoes, 1 Tbs olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.
* Toss until combined.
* Set aside.

### Cook the chicken

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
* In a 5Qt, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil.
* Add chicken and marinade and potatoes and sear, skin side down, 3 minutes, then flip and sear 3 minutes more.
* Cover and Transfer to the oven and bake until potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through. Approx 20 minutes. (If potatoes need longer to cook, transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest and continue cooking until tender.)
* Serve chicken and potatoes with pan drippings.

## Notes

* If you buy gluten-free mustard, then this recipe becomes gluten-free, as far as we can tell. Check for yourself and don't risk your health on my estimation, but it got the ok from my mother-in-law.
* Because the cooking time is short, cutting the potatoes into small pieces is key or else they won't get done. That's why I start with baby red potatoes and cut them into 8ths.

## Gear

I use my 5Qt, Le Creuset Brazier for this recipe. You can do the first part on the stove, cover it and put it in the oven, and even use it as a serving dish. Do keep in mind that it will be crazy hot if you use it to serve.
