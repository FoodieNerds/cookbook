# Gluten-Free Dutch Oven, Chicken Enchilada Casserole Recipe

![Chicken Enchiladas](https://github.com/FoodieNerds/cookbook/blob/master/images/ChickenEnchiladaCasserole.jpg "Chicken Enchiladas")

I found this recipe on givemesomeoven.com and made some modifications so ingredients would come out to even amounts, and so I would know what to buy. For example, the original recipe called for 16 tortillas, but they come in 12 packs. The original recipe also called for three cups of cheese, but they sell cheese by weight, not by how many cups it makes when you shred it, and I had no idea what size of a can of enchilada sauce to buy so I worked that out, too. Also, I wanted to use my 5qt Creuset braiser instead of a casserole dish so I could use the lid instead of aluminum foil to cover it, and also so it would stay warm longer after I took it out of the oven. Anyway, this fed 4 adults, a teen, and a 5-year-old, there were leftovers, and everyone liked it.

# Ingredients

* 28 oz red enchilada sauce
* 12 corn tortillas, halved
* 2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
* 6 green onions, thinly sliced
about 1 pound, shredded cooked chicken
* 1 lb shredded Monterrey Jack cheese
* 1 avocado, peeled, pitted and diced
* 1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh cilantro

# Preparation

* Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
* Prepare a 5qt Creuset braiser with cooking spray.
* If you buy fresh, ground chicken, then brown it before starting.


* Pour about 3/4 cup enchilada sauce in the baking dish, and spread until the bottom of the dish is coated.
* Top with a layer of about 6 tortilla halves so that the entire dish is covered.
* Sprinkle evenly with about black beans, cup and a fourth of the green onions.
* Then sprinkle with a chicken, and about shredded cheese.
* Repeat with the second layer of tortillas, then sauce, then beans, corn, green onions, chicken, and cheese.
* Then a final layer of tortillas, sauce, beans, corn, green onions, chicken, and cheese.
* Then conclude with a final layer of tortillas and sauce (reserving about 3/4 cup of cheese to add partway through baking).
* Cover the pan, then bake for 20 minutes.


* Remove pan from the oven and remove the lid.
* Sprinkle the top of the enchiladas evenly with the remaining 3/4 cup of cheese, then return to the oven (uncovered) and bake for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
* Remove the pan from the oven, and sprinkle with avocado, cilantro, and remaining green onions.
