# Dutch Oven Hoisin Chicken and Rice

Let's just start with my standard disclaimer that this is not an authentic recipe from the old country, especially since I (a Kansan) just made it up by combining two other recipes, in a dutch oven from France. My wife had the original recipe for Hoisin Chicken and it is simple and good. I added the dutch oven and rice parts by stealing the idea from [another recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-chinese-no-clay-pot-chi-137485). What you end up with are baked, chicken legs over rice. This got a "you are making this again" from my teenager and a "yummy food" from my five-year-old and his cousin.

P.S. I recently added peas and carrots to make this into another one-pot dinner. They didn't have hoisin sauce at my neighborhood grocery store, so I substituted teriyaki sauce and it was also great. We even tried an "Orange Sauce, Asian Glaze and Stir Fry" sauce and that was great, too, and it was gluten-free. If you use gluten-free flour and soy sauce then the whole thing becomes gluten-free.

# Ingredients
* 10 or more drumsticks
* 1 C hoisin sauce or teriyaki sauce
* 1/2 C brown sugar
* 3T soy sauce
* 2T flour
* 1T Olive Oil
* 1 cup long-grain rice, preferably Chinese, rinsed
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1lb frozen peas and carrots

# Preparation

* Preheat oven to 475.
* In a large bowl, whisk hoisin, brown sugar, soy sauce, and flour.
* Add the drumsticks to the bowl, coat them with sauce and place in fridge until needed.
* Add the olive oil to a 5QT dutch oven and place over medium-high heat.
* When the oil is hot, add the rice and sauté the rice briefly to develop some toasty flavor (you don’t want to brown the rice here, just sauté it for 1 minute or so - and stir well so it doesn't stick or burn).
* Pour in the stock.
* Add the sauce and the coated chicken mixture from the fridge.  
* Add the frozen peas and carrots.
* Bring to a boil.
* Cover and place the dutch oven in the oven.
* Roast at 475 until cooked through, 40-45 minutes.
* Chicken legs should be at least 165F internal temp at this point and ready to eat.
