I'm not sure where we found the original recipe, but I do know that we have changed it quite a bit. Baked Ziti is a family favorite in our house, and it makes plenty of leftovers for lunches.

## Ingredients

* 1-pound package uncooked ziti or penne (short tube-shaped pasta)
* 1 pound chicken Italian sausage
* 1 chopped onion
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 little can of tomato paste
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 (14.5-ounce) cans petite diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
* 2 chopped zucchini
* Cooking spray
* 8 ounces shredded fresh mozzarella cheese
* 8 ounces shredded fresh Parmesan cheese

## Preparation

* Preheat oven to 350°.
* Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Drain the pasta, and set aside.
* Cook sausage, onion, basil, zucchini, and garlic in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, stirring to crumble.
* Add the tomato paste, salt, pepper, and tomatoes, and bring to a boil.
* Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Combine cooked pasta and sausage mixture.

### If using a casserole dish:

* Place half of the pasta mixture in a 4-quart casserole coated with cooking spray.
* Top with half of mozzarella and half of Parmesan.
* Repeat layers.

### If using a 5QT Creuset Brasier dutch oven:

* Put half of both of the cheeses into the pasta and stir well.
* Put the other half on top.
* Put in the oven uncovered.

### Bake:
* Bake at 350° for 20 minutes or until bubbly.
