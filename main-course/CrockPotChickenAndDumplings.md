# Crock-Pot Chicken and Dumplings

My Mom learned to make homemade chicken and dumplings from my great-grandmother who was born to German immigrants in 1888. This is not that recipe. Those dumplings tasted amazing, but I think that they took my Mom hours to make. I have not got that kind of time. This recipe goes together fast and tastes great. Our family of four always has leftovers for lunches, too.

We normally modify or fix recipes because they have some issue, but I make this one just as it is written.  To avoid plagiarizing, I'll just point you to [spendwithpennies.com](http://www.spendwithpennies.com/crock-pot-chicken-and-dumplings/), and I'll just add some notes:

## Notes

This recipe says to cook it for 5 hours on high, and then you add the biscuits and veggies and cook for another hour. I don't know about you, but I work more than 5 hours. I have started this, gone to work, and then done the hour on high with biscuits and veggies when I got home. It was still fine. The downside - it will be an hour+ until you can serve dinner after you get home.

## Gear

We have a basic Crock-Pot and it is a workhorse. I can only do fixed time periods so I just tell Siri to start a timer. The locking lid is handy when taking it for potluck events so high-g turns don't spill the food.
